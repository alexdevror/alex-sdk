# Design Overview

The OneApiSdk Ruby gem provides a user-friendly interface for accessing and interacting with TheOneApi. This document provides an overview of the design choices and architecture of the gem.

## Architecture

The OneApiSdk gem follows a simple and modular architecture, consisting of the following components:

1. **Client** : The `OneApiSDK::*` class serves as the entry point for making API requests. It handles the authentication using the API key and provides methods for accessing the different API endpoints.
2. **Endpoints** : The gem provides two main endpoints: `OneApiSDK::Movie` and `OneApiSDK::Quote`. Each endpoint is responsible for constructing and sending the corresponding API requests.
3. **Request Parameters** : The gem supports various request parameters that can be used to filter, sort, and paginate the API results. These parameters are implemented as methods in the endpoint classes.
4. **HTTP Requests** : The `OneApiSDK::Movie/Quote` class utilizes the `Net::HTTP` library to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints. It handles the creation of the request URL, adding the necessary headers, and parsing the response.

## Usage and Extensibility

The OneApiSdk gem is designed to be easy to use and extend. Users can follow these steps to utilize the gem:

1. Install the gem using Bundler or by directly installing the gem.
2. Create an instance of `OneApiSDK::Movie/Quote` by providing the API key.
3. Use the provided endpoint classes (`OneApiSDK::Movie` and `OneApiSDK::Quote`) to make API requests. These classes expose methods for filtering, sorting, and paginating the results.

The gem can be extended to support additional endpoints or new features by creating new classes that inherit from `OneApiSDK::Endpoint`. These new classes can implement the necessary methods and logic to interact with the new endpoints or features.

## Future Improvements

While the current design of the OneApiSdk gem provides a solid foundation for interacting with TheOneApi, there are several areas that could be improved in the future:

* Enhanced Caching: Implementing caching mechanisms could improve performance by reducing the number of API requests made.
* Additional Endpoints: The gem can be expanded to support more endpoints and functionalities offered by TheOneApi.
* Throttling and Rate Limiting: Incorporating mechanisms to handle API throttling and rate limiting would ensure smoother operation when interacting with the API.

## Conclusion

The OneApiSdk Ruby gem offers a user-friendly interface for accessing and interacting with TheOneApi. With its modular architecture and extensibility, it provides a solid foundation for making API requests and retrieving results in a convenient and efficient manner. By following the provided usage guidelines and considering future improvements, this gem can continue to evolve and meet the needs of developers working with TheOneApi.
